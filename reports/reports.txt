Data set used : MLB data set 

Feature engineering :

1)From the given data set derived how many times each team participated in MLB as team 1 and the count is returned to feature engineering.csv

2)From the given data set derived the number of points scored by each team and sorted them in ascending order, computed their mean and standard deviation.From this we can deduce which is the team with highest number of points

Model:

Used Linear regression model to predict the score using other columns as feature

Steps:
Read the data into pandas
Converting the datatypes of the column using encoding scheme
Checking the correlation between various columns
Dropping data column
Splitting the data set into training and testing sets
Model fitting using linear regression
Score prediction
Returning the predictions to pred1.csv in data folder.
